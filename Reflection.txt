In this semester I obtained several powerful tools on the computer and improved my skills in programming.
Now I'm skilled in using GitKraken and Spyder. As application supports, they are quite useful. I always like to revise a program again and again, and GitKranken makes it easy for me to push updates. Spyder also helps me a lot. I prefer to write a part of the code quickly and then debug it. Spyder can automatically check my code, so bugs are reduced. If some bugs remain, Spyder also provides me debug tools and variable explorer. I believe they will be useful tools in my future career.
In addition, I learned how to make simple programs in python. I had learned simple algorithms in Free Pascal before this semester, but I didn't really understand some working principles behind it since I was too small at that time. I know more knowledge about programming. For example, now I truly understand the idea underlies quicksort and know how to calculate algorithm complexity. In addition to algorithms, I improved my application ability. Python is much more powerful than Free Pascal. It is convenient to draw figures and output Excel files in Python. With python, I can easily put my knowledge of programming into practice.
Informatics brought me many happy times. Although I don't like most other courses, I would forget myself in IBI practicals for the whole Wednesday morning. I felt cool when I typed command lines, and when the program had been finished, it gave me great pleasure. I would like to study further in Informatics and work in relevant fields in future, because it is quite interesting.
